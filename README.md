# Creating a sql Database and running queries to analyse data and create reports

Using MySQL, I created three databases for an e-commerce company that stores inventory data, invoicing data, as well as customer and orders data, along with employee information: sql_hr, sql_inventory, sql_invoicing, and sql_store.

After creating the database, I was able to query the data to analyze it and create reports. I utilized functions and clauses such as SELECT, FROM, INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, USING, WHERE, GROUP BY, WITH ROLLUP, HAVING, ORDER BY, EXISTS, ANY, IN, and subqueries.


# Analysis

* Create a report that aggregates total sales and total payments for the first half of the year and the second half of the year
